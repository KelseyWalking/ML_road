# Machine Learning Road  
This repository is a collection of my machine learning projects, resources, and experiments—documenting my journey into Data Science and applied ML.

## Purpose
I explore machine learning through fun business and personal projects. I will keep documenting my ideas, step-by-step ML workflows, and learnings as I continue exploring.
Some original data from my past work cannot be used, so I replace them with similar public datasets and build prototype projects using my own ideas.  

## Content
This repo includes projects: pricing optimization frameworks, demande forecasting framework, recommendation framework, and customer clustering models.
